# catalog-arvo-final
final combination of repos

note - all development is doen in the .xcworkspace file. This is where you should run the app to see the simulator or to test anything

Notes: the phone authentication is not being used. will be implemented later down the line. Email and name is more straightforward
Some of the UI is clunky & dark mode stuff is a bit wonky. How should we target this? is there an easy fix?
I threw a random "loku" image in the singin and signup views. doesnt look great so we should figure out a better solution for that
